/**
 * `nexus workbook` (epic #405): the verb that makes a workbook, renders it, and starts a session
 * on it.
 *
 * Without this verb the store, the renderer and the handoff records are code nobody can reach: a
 * lesson author has no way to turn prose into a page, and a learner has no way to come back to the
 * story a session handed off. Each subverb is a thin caller over one capability, and none of them
 * re-implements any of it — placement comes from `workbook-placement.ts`, the store's layout from
 * `workbook-store.ts`, the rendering from `workbook-render.ts`, and the pause from `handoffs.ts`.
 *
 * Rendering is deliberately all-or-nothing at this surface too: `render` reports the lesson that
 * failed and leaves no pages behind, so a learner never opens a workbook that is part new and part
 * stale. `check` is the other half of committing generated output: it re-renders and compares, so a
 * page edited by hand — or left behind by a lesson that changed — is caught in review rather than
 * read as if it were current.
