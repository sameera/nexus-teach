/**
 * Approval (epic #458, decision record #591): the step that turns a clean draft into the committed plan
 * the shipped teaching session reads.
 *
 * Every field of the committed plan has an owner. Approval fills in what the issue graph and the
 * workspace already know — the pinned states, the lesson names, the branches, each slice's epic, the
 * dependency edges and the repository. The reviewer declares the suite and grading commands. The
 * session writes each pinning test when the learner arrives at its slice. A field whose owner has not
 * acted yet is absent, never a placeholder, because the session acts on the value (invariants 26, 27).
 *
 * The plan is built field by field from a fixed list rather than copied from the draft and stripped.
 * A field added to the draft later — or one of the learner's declared phrases, which the draft carries
 * for the gate — has no route into a committed file until someone adds it to this list on purpose
 * (invariant 25). A list fails closed; a strip list fails open, and a leak into a committed file cannot
 * be undone.
