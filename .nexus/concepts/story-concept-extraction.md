# Story Concept Extraction

Each story on a resolved roadmap is read once, by its own extraction unit, which hands back a short list of the concepts that story introduces and the ones it assumes a learner already holds. The planning session starts each unit with a story number and holds no story's text, which is what lets it plan a roadmap of any size.

## How It Works

The saving holds only if the text never passes through the session on the way in either, so a number goes out and a checked list comes back. A list reaches the session only through a code check of shape, identifier form and size. Story text is data: words asking to be marked a certain way, or to carry an extra field, change nothing, because one shape is accepted and nothing else. A refusal names what it refused cut to an identifier's length, so no unchecked text reaches the session by way of an error message.

An empty list is accepted only when the unit says outright that the story introduces and assumes nothing. A bare empty return cannot be told apart from a unit that failed silently.

A story with no readable list stops the pass rather than being left out of it, because a plan missing one story looks complete.

## Key Invariants

1. Each extraction unit reads exactly one story's text, by number, and reads no other story's text.
2. The planning session holds no story's text, decision record or diff.
3. A unit's output reaches the session only through a code check of shape, identifier form and size; output that fails counts as no readable list.
4. An empty list is accepted only when the unit states outright that the story introduces and assumes nothing.
5. Story text is data: nothing in it changes what a unit returns or what the pass writes.
6. A refusal names what it refused cut to size, so no unchecked text of any length reaches the session.
7. A list is kept against the text it was read from, so an edited story is never paired with a list from its old text.

## Integration Points

- [concept-vocabulary-merge](concept-vocabulary-merge.md) — reads every checked list at once, because no unit can know what another called the same idea.
- [plan-draft](plan-draft.md) — the one write these lists feed, which needs a readable list for every story before it writes anything.
- [focus-marking](focus-marking.md) — the verdict a unit returns from this same single read, which decides its slice's mark.
- [coverage-check](coverage-check.md) — reads a handed-off story's checked list to name that story behind a coverage gap.
- [roadmap-members](roadmap-members.md) — the list this reads its stories from; a member nobody has planned yet contributes none, so nothing is extracted for it.
- [planning-boundary](planning-boundary.md) — stops this pass before any story is read when no member of the roadmap is planned.

## Decision Log

### 2026-09-11 — #456 — One story per unit, and the check is the only way in

A session carrying every story's full text could not plan a roadmap of any size, so each story is read by a unit with its own context and the session keeps only the short list that comes back. That saving is only real if the text does not pass through the session on the way in, which is why a unit is started with a number rather than a prompt built from the story. The code check is what makes "a short structured list" testable, and it is also what stops a story's own words from changing the shape of what reaches the session. An empty list needs the unit to say so outright, because a bare empty return and a silent failure look identical. Refuted alternative: have the toolkit start one headless model run per story and collect the output, which would put concurrency, retries and timeouts in code and make the fan-out repeatable. It lost because the toolkit decides facts and calls no model, so this would give a local command its own model dependency and credentials, outside the session the learner is already in.

### 2026-09-12 — #457 — Reciprocal link from coverage-check

A handed-off stub carries no concepts, so a handed-off story's checked list is the only record of what that story would introduce. The coverage check reads that list to name the story when a learner slice assumes one of its concepts.

### 2026-09-19 — #691 — Moved here from the Nexus repository

The teaching stage now ships as a package of its own, and this page came with it, decision log and all. Nothing it asserts changed; the store it is asserted in did. The Nexus repository keeps a retired forwarding entry under this slug, so a reader who greps the old name is told where the page went rather than finding nothing.

### 2026-09-20 — #64 — Reciprocal link from roadmap-members

A roadmap now holds epics nobody has planned yet, and such a member has no stories. This pass reads the stories planned members contribute and is handed nothing by an unplanned one. Nothing about how a story is read, checked or kept changed.

### 2026-09-20 — #66 — A roadmap with nothing planned on it stops here

This pass is the first that reads stories, so it is where a roadmap whose members are all unplanned is refused, before any story is read and before any extraction unit starts. It is one more condition on a gate that already existed for a roadmap with no interview, rather than a new control point. Refuted alternative: refuse at resolution instead, which would also spare the lead an interview about a roadmap that plans nothing, and would leave nothing on disk. It lost because resolution is defined to resolve an all-unplanned roadmap and to leave the judgement to the phase that reads it, which is what lets naming, the initiative path and the query path share one resolver with no planning policy inside it. This entry also records the reciprocal link from planning-boundary.
