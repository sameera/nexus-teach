# Workbook Store

A workbook is a committed folder a learner opens, holding the authored lessons and the pages rendered from them. It sits beside the queue and the discovery store under the same hidden root, so all three share one location convention and one exclusion family. A repository may hold one workbook per roadmap, and in a workspace with a hub and members a workbook belongs to the member repository whose roadmap it teaches.

## How It Works

The store is created on first use and holds one folder per workbook. Inside a workbook the authored lessons sit in their own folder, and the pages render beside them at the workbook's root. An optional plan names the lessons in teaching order. Without a plan the order is the lessons' file names, which is deterministic but says nothing about teaching. A lesson the plan does not name fails the render. A plan naming a lesson the folder lacks fails too, unless the plan describes slices, where an unwritten lesson is a stub. Ordering by a file-name prefix alone was refuted, because renaming a lesson to move it would change its page's address. Placement is enforced in code rather than documented. Creating a workbook refuses a hub checkout and names the members it could have meant, and it resolves the member from the checkout it ran in, or from an explicit name when run from the hub. Creating a workbook also ensures the ignore rule that covers the learner folder, because the store is created on first use while ignore rules are seeded at setup.

## Key Invariants

1. The workbook store is committed and sits outside the queue.
2. No workbook path appears in any diff a Nexus stage derives.
3. A workbook lives in the member repository whose roadmap it teaches; creating one in a hub checkout is refused, and the refusal names the members it could have meant.
4. The store holds many workbooks, because a repository may teach more than one roadmap.
5. ~~A plan and the lessons folder must name the same lessons, or the workbook does not render.~~ A lesson the plan does not name never renders; a plan of slices tolerates one not yet written.
6. Without a plan the teaching order is the lessons' file names.
7. Creating a workbook ensures the ignore rule covering the learner folder rather than assuming setup did.

## Integration Points

- [learner-folder](learner-folder.md) — the one folder inside this store holding everything the workbook retains about a person.
- [lesson-renderer](lesson-renderer.md) — reads the lessons and the plan this store lays out, and writes the pages back into it.
- [teaching-plan](teaching-plan.md) — the plan of slices this store holds, which makes an unwritten lesson a stub rather than a mismatch.
- [workbook-home-page](workbook-home-page.md) — the page written at the workbook's root beside the lesson pages, from the plan this store holds.
- [reference-page](reference-page.md) — the authored prose of reference pages, one file per concept, in its own folder beside the lessons and never named in the plan.
- [roadmap-resolution](roadmap-resolution.md) — creates the workbook once a roadmap resolves.
- [roadmap-naming](roadmap-naming.md) — settles the name this store takes as its slug, from the issue the lead named the roadmap by.

## Decision Log

### 2026-09-07 — #405 — The workbook joins the existing family of pipeline stores

The store is committed and sits beside the queue and the discovery store, under the hidden root those two already occupy, so the exclusion is one coherent family rather than three unrelated special cases. The member placement follows from what a workbook is. The queue lives in the hub because the distiller reads it, but a workbook is a reading surface for one repository's roadmap, so it belongs with that roadmap. Refuted alternative: a visible folder at the top of the repository, which a learner browsing in a file manager would find, since a hidden directory is invisible by default in most file browsers. It loses because it puts a Nexus-managed store outside the one root every other Nexus store lives in, and it splits the exclusion family into two shapes. The discoverability cost is bounded, because a learner reaches a page from a session or a link rather than by browsing.

### 2026-09-07 — #407 — A plan of slices makes an unwritten lesson a stub, not a mismatch

The refusal that fired when the plan named a lesson the folder did not hold assumed every lesson exists before anyone reads them. Under a plan of slices a lesson is written when the learner arrives at it, so an absent lesson is the normal state and the old refusal would block every workbook that teaches. The refusal therefore narrows to plans that list lessons, while the other half stands for both kinds: a lesson the plan does not name still has no place in the workbook. This entry also records the reciprocal link to the teaching plan, which the store now reads and hands to a session. Refuted alternative: keep the refusal absolute and have the planning stage write an empty lesson for every slice up front. It keeps one rule for both kinds of plan, but the workbook would then ship stub pages the navigation links to, which is the dead end the stub marking exists to avoid.

### 2026-09-13 — #458 — Reciprocal link from workbook-home-page

Mechanical reciprocity fan-out: the home page is written at a workbook's root beside the lesson pages, from the plan this store holds. The store's own rules are unchanged by it. Approval writes the plan and the pages together or not at all — the plan is staged beside its target and the previous pages are held while the new ones are written, so a failed render leaves both exactly as they were — which is the same all-or-nothing guarantee the render already gave, now spanning the plan as well.

### 2026-09-18 — #481 — Reciprocal link from reference-page

Mechanical reciprocity fan-out: a workbook now holds a folder of authored reference pages beside the lessons folder. The plan names none of them, because a reference page is not a step in the teaching order, so the agreement between the plan and the lessons is unchanged. A workbook with no such folder has earned no page yet.

### 2026-09-19 — #691 — Moved here from the Nexus repository

The teaching stage now ships as a package of its own, and this page came with it, decision log and all. What changed on arrival is the edges this page can declare: an edge names a page in the same store, and pipeline-store-exclusion, workspace-resolution stayed behind. Those interactions did not stop — the stage still reads what those pages describe — but a store cannot hold an edge whose other end is in another repository, and a dead edge reads as though the interaction lapsed. The page each one named keeps a retired forwarding entry there, so the relationship is still findable from that side.

### 2026-09-20 — #64 — Reciprocal link from roadmap-resolution

A workbook is still created only after its roadmap resolves, and it still takes its slug from the roadmap's name. That name now comes off the lowest-numbered member whichever kind it is, so a roadmap whose first member is an epic nobody has planned yet still names a workbook. The store's layout and placement rules are unchanged.

### 2026-09-20 — #65 — Reciprocal link from roadmap-naming

Where this store's slug comes from is now settled on its own page, because a roadmap can be named by one initiative issue number as well as by a list or a search. The slug is that roadmap's name, so the edge points at naming rather than at resolution, and the resolution edge keeps only the fact that resolving is what creates the workbook.
